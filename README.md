This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in R's data frame subsetting. The `bug.R` file contains code exhibiting the error, while `bugSolution.R` provides the corrected version. This error stems from the subtle nuances of how R handles logical operators within subsetting operations, specifically when combining multiple conditions using `&` or `|`. The corrected code clarifies the proper use of parentheses and logical operators to ensure accurate subsetting.
